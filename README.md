# TiMini Print Bluetooth Printer Tool
Alternative [desktop software for Chinese Bluetooth thermal printers](https://github.com/Dejniel/TiMini-Print/releases) that use proprietary protocols (not ESC/POS), as a replacement for apps like “Tiny Print”, “Fun Print”, “Phomemo”, or “iBleem”.
It supports almost all mini printers! Check the huge list of [supported Bluetooth printer models](#supported-printer-models), or report missing ones.
It lets you print images, PDFs, or plain text from your computer. It supports both a GUI and a “fire-and-forget” CLI mode

These printers are often sold on AliExpress and under generic names such as “thermal printer”, “mini printer”, or “cat printer”.
TiMini Print works on Windows, Linux, and macOS as a standalone tool without a system printer driver (it does not emulate a driver or print spooler)

## Motivation
I bought a Chinese mini printer and could not find any decent desktop software that met my expectations, so I wrote my own. This is also the kind of work I do professionally. If you need help with a similar problem, you can [contact me](https://inajiffy.eu/) — I can also help with [broader support or custom implementation](#looking-for-broader-support-or-implementation)

# We need you!
- This project is open source! Your small monthly support on [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/dejniel) can make a real difference and help keep it going—even a one-time donation helps. Building and maintaining a project like this takes a lot of time; if you find it useful, please consider supporting it so I can keep improving it: [support the project](https://buymeacoffee.com/dejniel)
- If you're a developer, contributions and bug reports are always welcome—please jump in. Especially if you use or build on non-Linux systems, please consider contributing fixes or improvements

## Looking for broader support or implementation?
- If you need security/reverse engineering, broader commercial support, or a custom implementation, feel free to [reach out](https://inajiffy.eu/). I work on broken systems, neglected integrations, and projects that are already end-of-life, unsupported — or simply unsupportable. I also handle custom implementation work that sits outside the usual support model

# Requirements
You can find the latest standalone executable files on the [releases page](https://github.com/Dejniel/TiMini-Print/releases) and choose the asset that starts with `TiMini-Print-GUI-...` or `TiMini-Print-Command-Line-...` for your platform, or you can build the project yourself

Theoretically, I support Windows, macOS, and Linux, but I test builds only on Ubuntu-like systems—if you need to run this elsewhere, please report issues or submit a fix :P

## Manual building requirements
- Python 3.8+
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` (Note: Windows + Python 3.13+: installing `winsdk` may require building binaries during download)
- (optional, GUI only) if `tkinter` is missing, install it from your system packages:
  Linux (Ubuntu/Debian): `sudo apt install python3-tk`
  macOS (Homebrew Python): `brew install python-tk`

# Quick start
If you use release binaries, run the downloaded executable directly.
If you build or run from source instead, use `python3 timiniprint_gui.py` or `python3 timiniprint_command_line.py`.

## Graphical user interface
You can scan, connect or disconnect with one button, choose a file, and print.
Start the graphical app by running the [downloaded executable file](#requirements).
On Linux, make sure it has execute permission first.

```bash
# Replace the filename below with the matching asset for your platform
chmod +x ./TiMini-Print-GUI-Linux-x86_64
./TiMini-Print-GUI-Linux-x86_64
```

Or run it from source:

```bash
python3 timiniprint_gui.py
```

## Command line interface
(the examples use Linux filenames)
- Print to the first supported Bluetooth printer:
  ```bash
  ./TiMini-Print-Command-Line-Linux-x86_64 /path/to/file.pdf
  ```

- Print to a specific Bluetooth printer:
  ```bash
  ./TiMini-Print-Command-Line-Linux-x86_64 --bluetooth "PRINTER_NAME" /path/to/file.pdf
  ```

- Print via a serial port (skip Bluetooth connection):
  ```bash
  ./TiMini-Print-Command-Line-Linux-x86_64 --serial /dev/rfcomm0 --model A200 /path/to/file.pdf
  ```

- Print raw text without creating a file:
  ```bash
  ./TiMini-Print-Command-Line-Linux-x86_64 --text "Hello from CLI"
  ```

- List available printer models:
  ```bash
  ./TiMini-Print-Command-Line-Linux-x86_64 --list-models
  ```

- Scan for supported printers:
  ```bash
  ./TiMini-Print-Command-Line-Linux-x86_64 --scan
  ```

## Notes
- If `--bluetooth` is omitted, the first supported printer found is used
- For `--serial`, you must pass `--model` (see `--list-models`)
- For Bluetooth printing, you can pass `--model` to override auto-detection

# Notes
- On first Classic connection on Windows/macOS, the system may request pairing confirmation
